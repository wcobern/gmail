Simple module to automate sending emails using gmail

I've been playing with my Raspberry Pi to make a few scripts which can run in the background to send automated notifications.

This module contains functionality to connect to a gmail account and send a text email to one or more recipients.

Note by default gmail doesn't allow connections from "Less Secure Apps"

But I wouldn't recommend doing it on you main account! I have a designated account I use for this.
